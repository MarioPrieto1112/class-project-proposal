<h2>Application Overview</h2>
<p>The overview for this assignment is to create a project that is able to properly draw a cat. The reasoning behind this is because earlier in the year we did TurtleDraw, so I decided why not try to do CatDraw.</p>
<h2>Technology Overview</h2>
<p>For my project, I'll be using python because I have a little bit of a background in the language. I decided that in Python I'll be using the drawing fearure to try to properly draw a cat. </p>
<h2>Last Updated</h2>
<p>The last update on the proposal was 11/20/23</p>
<h2>Feature List</h2>
<p>The feature that I hope to include are the Ability to open draw, Include all parts of the cat, able to draw a max speed, and an asthetically pleasing cat. </p>
<h2>Future Features</h2>
<p>Some features I'd include if I had more time would be a more detail drawing of the cat itself. Being that we only had a few weeks I had to make sure that the feautures of the cat would be able to be completed in the necessary time.  </p>
<h2>Technology Features advanced</h2>
<p>Something that we haven't gone over in class that I'd like to implement in my project is a advanced features in Python. I feel as if my knowledge for the language is sub-par compared to others in the class and I want a better understanding of it. In terms of what goes beyond the classs for this project I feel as if the entire project does. Being that I have to make a cat from basically nothing is going to be a massive challenge. </p>
