<p>The overview for this assignment is to create a project that Im proud of enough to the point where I'd be able to demo to a future job.</p>

<p>For my project, I'd like to use either HTML or Python because I have a minor background in both languages.</p>

<p>The last update on the proposal was 11/8/23</p>

<p>If there was more time I'd like to have a better background in Python. I feel as if I'd be able to create a better project with this advance knowledge in the language. </p>

<p>Some of the features that I'll be using in the project is HTML. I feel a lot more confident in my knowledge of HTML over Python.</p>

<p>Something that we haven't gone over in class that I'd like to implement in my project is a advanced features in Python. I feel as if my knowledge for the language is sub-par compared to others in the class and I want a better understanding of it.</p>
